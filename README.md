CREATE PROJECT TEMPLATE
=============
You've made it to your final coding project of the course!

We have learned **A LOT** in this course. For your final project, you will be applying all of these skills in order to crete an application of your own design.

TASK
----
**GOAL**: Create a program that is either (1) Fun/Silly, (2) Informative, or (3) Solves a Problem. Your final program should incorporate skills you have le

REQUIREMENTS
------------
In your program, you must include student-developed program code that contains the following:
- Instructions for input from one of the following:
  - the user (including user actions that trigger events)
  - a device
  - an online data stream
  - a file
- Use of at least one list or object to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
>The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).
- At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose,
where you have defined:
  - the procedure’s name
  - the return type (if necessary)
  - one or more parameters
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
>Implementation of built-in or existing procedures or language structures, such as event handlers or main methods, are not considered student-developed.
- An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection (if statements), and iteration (for/while loops) that is in the  body of the selected function
- Calls to your student-developed procedure
- Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality.
